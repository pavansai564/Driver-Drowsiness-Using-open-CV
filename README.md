# Driver Drowsiness Using Open CV

The primary objective of this project is to create a system for detecting drowsiness by monitoring the eyes and face, with the goal of identifying the symptoms of driver fatigue and driver distraction preventing potential car accidents. By utilizing a non-contact approach to assess levels of driver alertness, this detection system enables the early detection of declining alertness while driving. To accomplish this, the OpenCV algorithm was employed and a warning signal will be activated when anytype of distraction is detected to alert the driver.
